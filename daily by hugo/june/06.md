# Oh no, where is sunday ?
Okay stop don't panic, sunday is a sleepy day so nothing to write (or juste Zzzzz)  
I will talk about today, the First day in the thales office  
To begin the day, I walk something like 50min because i like this  
And when i arrived, victoria arrived too  
So we enter in the office, and i can begin a strange story (or not)  
First step, go to the reception and take badges to have the permission to go where we want  
I the same time, we meet remi.V, and we talk about many things  
After that, we are going to take our laptop, and said ok to Jesus (he's the IT technitian)  
ps: Me first, visctoria after because her laptop was not ok    
Remi.V showed us around his department (we are soo many, but not very in face-to-face)  
The difficulty arrive: Take some password, because the the change password website don't work always, but we arrived !  
And.. an other problem, connect to Teams: Error message is returning "contacte your administrator", so we do that but that was not clear, he come and he display to us a charter to sign "i accepte blablbabla"  
Oh, i forget, but thanks you very much remi.V to have help us ! (and whatch over us)  
After that we begin to read some doc, and at 15h o'clock, we meet Pavla to sign some paper and the contract, we ask a lot of question and we are rather happy because.. 9 day of holydays, good salary, many explanation, food card and good atmosphere  

So, we have 4 personnals missions :  
- Create account bank (faild today because.. it is on rendez-vous)  
- to do Police foreign gnagnagna to have the permission to stay in czech republique (too late)    
- Understand and begin the thales mission 
- I don't remeber the last one, sorry ^^'  

So, good and big day, we return at the appartment with our foots and we drink soft drink  
On that conclusion, good night and see you tomorrow for a new adventure !  
ps: don't panic, some picture arrive, but is more difficult because I have the laziness to connect my phone to my pc
