# 1 days in one, just to be up date
Yesterday i can't write my daily news paper because I fell asleep  
So today, you will have the right to have 2 days in one ! (or not, after reflexion)

The previous day has not many difference compared to usual: Get up, go to work, work, eat, work, go to home  
But as unusual, we went to the meeting to obtain our bank account.  
The story can begin here five hours before this event (so, the morning)  
We arrive at work and we don't have yet admin right on our computer to install sofware and work proprely  
So we continu to do some documentation (and it's was very annoying)  
But at the moment to eat, the last personn of the team that we had not yet met, is arrived;  
After ashort discussion, we decided to go to eat at a chiness self-serve buffet  
Personnaly, i found that was a good idea because.. What is better in life than being able to eat as much as you want ???  
When the meal was over, victoria and me had to go to the famous appoitment with the banker  
With just half hours early (time to visit nearby shops)  
The banker welcomes us, and we started talking about the contract: he ask us some information like age or address, take id card to verify our identity and he complete a form on his computer.  
Then we install an application on our phone and signed documents, some in English, some in Czech (thank google traduction)  
So, in only 30 minutes, we've done that  
Moreover, as students we have a lot of advantage like free account and free card (that we receive in 2 weeks, in the meantime we can use Google pay)  
The rest of the day rest basic like a peace of cake (and big deal with my bed)
