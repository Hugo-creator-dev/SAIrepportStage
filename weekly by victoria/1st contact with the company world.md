# 1st contact with the company world

This week was one of the most tiring and full weeks that I had the chance to experience.
To begin with, I begin my travel to Prague at 3 in the morning with a car ride from Toulon to Marseille to be ready to take of at 6. When we arrived at 8, we had a bit less than 2 hours to wait until we could obtain our apartment keys. Previously in the year, we decided to be roommates, which was a good idea, because if one of use forget to turn on our alarm clock, the other one could wake them up. (But I later learn that trying to wake Hugo up is a task as hard as trying to fight the Nemean lion) 
After taking a little breakfast on the go in one of the little shops located at the exit of the subway, we decided to retrieve our keys a bit early. We unpacked our luggage and then went in a quest to find an ATM that would not scam us and ended up walking about 10 km this day. I then took Hugo to Palladium, a nice 5 floor mall near the city centre, to grab a piece to eat. We also bought all the necessary item to survive (yes, survive) the first week. And that is how we wrapped up the day.
On Saturday, we made a trip to Ikea and then came home to sleep. 
On Sunday, I went to walk a bit by myself and explore the surrounding, mostly around the museum. When I came back, Hugo suggested that we could go out, so we did! (What happened to my introvert self â˜¹) We ate at Vapiano an extremely good lasagne and after we came back, I fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow.

We begin our work on Monday, at 9 in the morning and for the remainder of the week, we experienced the gears of a big company. Between the waiting for permissions and to obtain our workstation, we worked on our documentation and on discovering the new technologies that we would use during our internship.
We also decided to open a Czech banc account, to avoid having to pay exorbitant conversion fees and to receive our salary more easily.
Finally, we meet our other roommates. In our apartment, there is a German guy, an Irish guy, and a Belgian girl. In the studio next to us lives another French guy. They are nice and funny people, and we have been to a bar with them, but the fatigue suddenly hit me like a ton of bricks, and I had to go home. (There she is! The lovely introvert ðŸ˜‰)

Thanks for coming to this week report and see you next week ~!
